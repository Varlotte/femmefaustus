        <strong>I love:</strong> unsolved things, archival research,
        world-building, queering genre fiction, complicated women+, dalliances
        with unlikeability, mysteries, the monstrous, magical realism, and the
        tragedy of ghosts. Learning to be a better intersectional feminist.
        Constructivism and different brains. Languages in all their twisty
        graftings and illogical roots. I love humor, games, and the way children
        tell stories. Consent. Exuberance. Revenge. Punch lines and poptimism.

        <strong>I know:</strong> that I’m not done yet. Not even close. I’m
        always looking for new collaborators who I can learn from and create
        with. If you want to be one of those people please{" "}
